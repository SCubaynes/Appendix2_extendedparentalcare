This repertory contains guidance to fit the model to the polar bear data, R code, data files, and
additional results associated with the article "Modeling the demography of species providing extended parental care: 
A capture-recapture multievent model with a case study on Polar Bears (Ursus maritimus)
" by authors Sarah Cubaynes, Jon Aars, Nigel G. Yoccoz, Roger Pradel, Ã˜ystein Wiig, Rolf A Ims and Olivier Gimenez.

Step-by-step instructions are provided in the file "Appendix2_fitbeardata.Rmd" (or the pdf version).
